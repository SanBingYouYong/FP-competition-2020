This is my entry for the FP Programming Contest. I developed a series of my own L-systems with new colours. The code is built upon the code for Tutorial 7. To run the code, use display (name number of iterations) just like with the other L-systems. I have added comments at the end of each L-system which indicate the desired output. If there are problems the code should run on the original tutorial 7 file with the updated LSystem.hs as I have added my own colours
