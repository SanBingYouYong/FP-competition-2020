Project title: Combinatorics in Fractal geometry  

 

Project Information: The code in the file attached is an algorithm for deciding which pairs of rationals to connect. This is based on Lavaurs’ algorithm which is an extension of the Mandelbrot set and Julia Sets. The abstract Mandelbrot set is obtained by drawing arcs between the pairs of rationals and collapsing each arc to a point.

 

Attached is an image I found particularly interesting in understanding and explaining how the algorithm works.

The picture illustrates Lavaurs' algorithm for features through period 5.

Here the point of period 1 (0),

  the points of period 2 (1/3 and 2/3)

  and of period 3 (1/7, 2/7, 3/7, 4/7, 5/7, 6/7),

  along with some of period 4 and 5, are shown on the circle.

The points of period 4 are those fractions with denominator 15, excluding 0, 5/15 = 1/3, and 10/15 = 2/3, fractions already in the list because they have period 1 (x = 0) or 2 (x = 1/3 and x = 2/3).

(Note, a fixed point constitutes a 4-cycle, and the points of a 2-cycle are also points of a 4-cycle.)

The points of period 5 are those fractions with denominator 31. All of these, except 0, are new points because 5 is prime.

 

 

Instructions to run the file:

 

    Type ghci stack
    Load the file
    To run it type :main “depth” where “DEPTH” where DEPTH = the desired depth i.e. 1,2,3… wanting to be explored. To replicate the picture above – type          :main “5”
    An HTML code will be outputted ( I tried linking it to a HTML file but was running into the following error so I sincerely apologize in advance for the slightly longer steps to view the project. 

GLUT Fatal Error: internal error: NSInternalInconsistencyException, reason: NSWindow drag regions should only be invalidated on the Main Thread!

    Copy the code outputted and paste it in https://codepen.io/ . To do that, create a new project, paste the code under the HTML tab and “save and run” it. To view the html click on “export” and then (finally!) download the zipped folder with the html link to the visualization. 

 

As the depth increases, the html code can be tedious to copy and paste in codepen,

So the desired and aesthetically pleasing picture to look at has been linked.

This is of depth 10. Alternatively, open the zipped folder.
