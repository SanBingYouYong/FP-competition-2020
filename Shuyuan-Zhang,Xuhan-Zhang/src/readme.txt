Explanation: 
There is the shape of a person in the middle of one's eye. 
This can be interpreted as lovers looking at each other. 
If there is one thing in this universe that is eternal, or one ultimate answer to all questions, it is love. 
That's why this graph is named as "uInMyEye". 
Another point: 
This function will only generate such graph with the input 7, and it is just like love that we will only meet our true love once in our life.
